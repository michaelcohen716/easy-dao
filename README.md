# EasyDAO

Decentralized governance is an exciting topic and a promising development for Web3. However, DAOs are complicated and require a high amount of effort. EasyDAO is a low commitment DAO generator that will be useful but also educational, while leaving the more involved discussions for another day.

If you're organizing a professional event, a group trip or a charitable giving drive, EasyDAO is a simple and transparent way to find consensus without overloading members of the group with technical details.
